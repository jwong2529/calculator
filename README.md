# calculator

This is the fifth and final project of the The Odin Project foundations curriculum and is a functioning calculator.

This project is the culmination of all I have learned during Foundations which includes HTMl, CSS (flexbox), and JavaScript (DOM manipulation, arrays, objects, event listeners, etc).
